# Static Comp One

A coding student's second attempt at building a functioning website from a provided comprehensive layout.

#### Description
Static Comp One — otherwise known as Card UI, otherwise-otherwise known as Cardi B — is my second individual project as a front end developer at Turing School in Denver, CO. The project served to solidify basic HTML/CSS concepts and provide much-needed repititions writing basic code. No JavaScript was harmed in the making of this website.

#### Finished Product
Static Comp One finished project by Mark R. Collins

#### Biggest Win
Sitting down with psuedo code and writing code without looking at notes or referencing Google. The pace at Turing is so fast you don't realize you really *are* learning things. Being able to speak the language and have the code do what I intended was a solidifying moment and harbinger of good things to come. I'm also pretty darn pleased with my fade-in hover effects.

#### Biggest Struggle
My continued ineptitude with GitHub. In an effort to familiarize myself with GitHub and the terminal I set out to do this entire project through GitHub as if I was my own partner. First mistake was not making often enough commits. Second mistake was doing something — still don't know what — which reverted my local files and removed the commit I'd just made. Having undone 4-5 hours of work, I took pause, reminded myself this was good practice and vowed to improve my GitHub skills. Then avoided GitHub for the rest of the project.

#### Assignment
Assigned comprehensive layout (note: creative liberty allowed for content)
